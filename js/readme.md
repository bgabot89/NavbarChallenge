The purpose of this project is to take on the front-end challenge of making a functional navbar. 

It is unclear in the challenge which framework I should use (node.js, ruby on rails, etc...) and there is no specification under the reading if I need to implement any type of backend functionality for the login/logout functionality. 

For now, I'll be using just Javascript and jQuery for login/logout functionality to appear/dissapear and HTML and css for styling and creating the DOM.
